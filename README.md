# 🌍 Prediction of Disease Outbreaks Using Machine Learning 🦠  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **predicting disease outbreaks** using **machine learning models** to assist healthcare professionals in **early detection, risk assessment, and outbreak management**. By leveraging **epidemiological, demographic, and environmental data**, the system provides **actionable insights** for public health preparedness.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Cleans and transforms raw outbreak data for analysis.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifies disease trends, correlations, and risk factors.  
✅ **Machine Learning Models** – Uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for outbreak prediction.  
✅ **Accuracy & Performance Metrics** – Evaluates models using **Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.  
✅ **Interactive Streamlit Deployment** – Provides a **user-friendly web interface** for real-time predictions.  
✅ **Model Saving & Deployment** – Saves trained models using `pickle` for later use.
